# CircleOps - The Home of `circlectl`

**_This project is still in early development_**

CircleOps is a project that provides a command - `circlectl` - that can be used to interact with the CircleCI API.

## Installation 

`go get -u github.com/jaymickey/circleops/cmd/circlectl`

## Development

This project uses Go Modules, therefore the repo can be cloned into any location of the filesystem, and doesn't require `$GOPATH`. However, it does require **at least Go v1.11**.
